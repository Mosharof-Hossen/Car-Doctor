# Project Name : [Car Doctor](https://car-doctor-app-1.web.app/)


## Features: 
admin: admin@admin.com pass: 123456
1. This is a Car Services website.
2. Service Checkout: Users can browse services and view detailed information. To proceed with a service checkout, users must log in. If not logged in, they are redirected to the login page, and after successful login, theyâ€™re taken back to the checkout.
3. Order Management: Users can view all their ordered services in the cart. They have the ability to delete any unwanted orders. The cart is a protected feature, accessible only to logged-in users.
4. Admin Panel: Admins have access to a special route where they can view all user orders. From this panel, they can update the status of orders to Pending, Ongoing, Confirmed, or Canceled.
5. Authentication: The website uses Firebase Authentication, allowing users to sign in via Email/Password, Google, or GitHub. This ensures secure access to protected routes like the checkout and cart pages.
6. Data Security: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to secure APIs and ensure only authorized users (like admins) can access restricted routes, providing additional security.
7. Data Storage: MongoDB is used to store user information, service details, and order data efficiently and securely.
8. Hosting: The entire application is hosted on Firebase, ensuring fast, scalable, and reliable performance. Server is hosted on Vercel.
9. Both the server site and the client site were challenging. I enjoyed it.
